        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups of flour</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>4 egg yolks</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 packet of dry yeasts</li>
            <li>3 cup of sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of rum</li>
            <li>Plenty of oil to fry (at least 4 cups)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the filling & topping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of powdered sugar</li>
            <li>Candied orange peel (optional)</li>
            <li>Jam, cream, anything you want to fill your paczki with</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instuctions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl put a tablespoon of flour, 3 tablespoons of warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Mix it all well, cover with a rag and set aside for 20 minutes. It should become all fluffy and foamy.</li>
            <li>Mix the rest of the flour with egg yolks and melted butter. Then add the rest of your milk (not warm this time) and rum. The rum will make your paczki absorb less oil when frying later.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough with hands for about 5 minutes. Cover with a rag and set to grow in a warm place for about 45 mins to an hour - you can use an oven shelf for that.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is grown, set some flour on the dough board. Roll out the fluffy dough gently to a thickness of about 1" and cut out round paczki (you can use a bigger cup or glass to do it).</li>
            <li>Form your cut out paczki round, but slightly flatter on top and bottom.</li>
            <li>Fry them in oil heated to 345 F for about 2/3 minutes on each side, then place on paper towels to remove the excess oil.</li>
            <li>Once cooled down, stuff them with a filling of your choice. You can sprinkle powdered sugar on top or prepare frosting with melted sugar and candied orange peels.</li>
        </ol>
